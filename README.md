Project title: DJANGO BLOG

Description: Django blog is an online blogging application that allows users to be able
to create and upload blog posts and also read the blog posts of other users.
This application allows you to:
1. create account
2. login, if you already have an account
3. reset your password if need be(maybe forgotten password)
4. create and upload blog posts
5. edit and delete blog posts
6. make comments on blog posts(if you are logged in)

I used Django framework in building this application because, that was the instruction 
by my mentor and Django framework has alot of built in libraries that
make the work easy.

I faced a number of challenges in building this application. one major challenge I faced was hosting the application on heroku.

I plan on making the frontend look more organised soon. I am open to anyone
who is willing to join me in getting that done since I am not very friendly with designs.

I am grateful to my friends and Zuri mentors(Femi) for their support and always being available to help 
and answer my questions.
